"How should transaction_type be selected?
Simple dropdown (e.g., 'transfer', 'payment') or let user type?
Dropdown", "Do we want to show fraud probability score (like 0.83) to the user?

Or keep that only for admin mode or internal logging? Yeah we will show the user the score", "Should secret key override be available to all users or only specific roles? yeah it should be avilable to all of them but only for smaller transactions for larger transactions which are detected fraud are cancelled anyway", "Do you already store geo location or ip in user profile?
If not, we can start with current session values. we did not store we have to do that", "Do we need to allow retry/edit option if fraud is flagged?
E.g., after a failed transaction, the user can fix and resubmit. we don't allow to do that transaction until the two step verification is done but for now let's not go that deep and not let the user try to do the transaction again" ,
