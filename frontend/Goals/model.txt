Great — you're at a crucial turning point where organizing your modeling pipeline, goals, and demo plan will ensure you stay focused and can both explain and prove your system’s intelligence clearly.

Here's a complete breakdown of what you’re building, your goals, and how to stay organized step-by-step:

✅ PROJECT GOALS (Keep these in mind always)
1. Build a Realistic Fraud Detection Model
Detect anomalous transactions using meaningful, behavior-driven features.

Must achieve good accuracy (>85%) on synthetic but realistic data.

Must support overrides (e.g., secret key) for user-controlled fraud bypass.

2. Simulate and Visualize User Behavior Patterns
Every user has a profile based on transaction history (like avg amount, typical times).

The system should flag a transaction as fraudulent when it deviates from this behavior.

These patterns must be visible in the frontend and explainable.

3. Demonstrate the Model's Intelligence
Show how the model flags a smart anomaly (e.g., sudden location change).

Allow overriding low-risk frauds using a secret key or PIN.

Make the logic transparent — so judges see how and why the model decided “Fraud”.

🎯 SYSTEM COMPONENTS OVERVIEW
Component	Purpose
Synthetic Data Generator	Create thousands of user-specific transactions, 90% legit, 10% fraud
Feature Engineering	Convert transaction logs into behavior-based features
Model Training Pipeline	Train a fraud detection model using these features
Real-Time Predictor API	Expose a /predict endpoint to classify new transactions
Dashboard (Frontend)	Visualize user stats, recent transactions, and model outputs
Fraud Visualizer (optional)	Highlight profile and show why something is flagged

🧠 FINAL FEATURE SET (12 features)
These are already finalized:

✅ Base Transaction Features
sender_id, recipient_id — User identities

amount — Transaction amount

time_of_day — Bucketed time (e.g. Morning/Night)

day_of_week — Day of the week (0–6)

transaction_type — Optional (e.g. top-up, P2P)

✅ User Behavior Features
avg_amount_last_10

txn_count_last_24h

recipient_diversity

is_known_recipient (binary)

✅ Device/Location Metadata
device_id (hashed or encoded)

geo_distance_km

ip_change_flag (boolean)

📋 ORGANIZED DEVELOPMENT PLAN
PHASE 1: Data Generation
 Create 1000 users using faker

 Assign each user:

Normal time of day (e.g. active 10am–6pm)

Normal amount range (e.g. ₹100–₹1500)

Regular recipients (3–5 known contacts)

Default device_id and location

 Generate 100–500 transactions per user:

90% follow pattern → label = 0 (Legit)

10% violate pattern → label = 1 (Fraud)

PHASE 2: Feature Engineering
 Extract rolling user behavior features (from past transactions)

 Compute:

avg_amount_last_10

txn_count_last_24h

recipient_diversity

etc.

 Output to a CSV with all 12 features + is_fraud

PHASE 3: Model Training
 Use RandomForestClassifier (start simple)

 Train on 80% of data, test on 20%

 Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC

PHASE 4: Real-Time Prediction API
 Build /predict endpoint in Flask

 Accept raw transaction input

 Extract features dynamically (user history, etc.)

 Return Legitimate or Fraudulent

PHASE 5: Frontend Demo
 User logs in → dashboard shows:

Their recent txns

Their typical profile (charts: avg amount, common hours)

 Submit new transaction

 Backend:

Builds features

Predicts

Flags fraud if deviated

 Frontend shows:

“Fraudulent: because recipient is new and amount is 3× usual”

Allow override if low risk

🚀 Presentation & Explainability Goals
 Use clear charts/graphs to show:

“This user usually sends ₹100–₹200, but this one is ₹5000 at 3am”

 Explain how model learns per-user profiles

 Demonstrate secret key override for low-risk fraud

 Emphasize your innovation: behavior-based fraud logic

✅ Summary: What to Always Keep in Mind
Your system is not just detecting fraud — it’s learning and modeling individual user behavior, then flagging deviations as fraud.
This is what makes it different, intelligent, and impressive.
